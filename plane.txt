Make it easy and research

We want to mak eit Camera-based so pose estimation or object tracking using a SMARTPHONE CAMERA.

For camera ise google mediapipe pose or openmpose
can tracj joints positions like wrists elbows, shoulders, we can track a bat 
by using markers or detect it via vision models

5. Batting Mechanics
Key metrics to analyze:

Backlift angle

Swing speed

Follow-through

Batting stance

Contact point (sweet spot)

Knowing cricket biomechanics helps you make features like “stroke quality scoring” or “form correction”

Excellent — a web app is an awesome choice for accessibility and fast prototyping. Let’s lay out exactly how to build this as a web-based cricket batting form analyzer.

📱💻 Web App Plan Overview
Main Tech Stack


Component	Tool/Framework	Language
Frontend	React.js (with Vite or Next.js)	JavaScript
Pose Estimation	MediaPipe Pose (via MediaPipe JS)	JavaScript
Styling	Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS)	CSS
Optional Backend (for storing session data)	FastAPI	Python
Deployment	Vercel / Netlify	—
📊 Workflow
User Flow:

Open Web App

Allow webcam access

Pose estimation runs via MediaPipe JS

Detect swing + track key landmarks

Compare key joint positions & angles at specific points in the swing

Display:

Live skeleton overlay

Text-based feedback: “Backlift too high” / “Bat angle too low”

Option to record session & review

📦 Key Tools You’ll Use:
📦 React.js for interactive UI

📦 MediaPipe Pose JS for real-time pose estimation via webcam

📦 Canvas API or Three.js (optional) to overlay skeleton landmarks on video feed

📦 Tailwind CSS for clean UI design

🔧 Step-by-Step Build Plan
📌 1️⃣ Set Up React Project
bash
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest cricket-form-analyzer -- --template react
cd cricket-form-analyzer
npm install
npm run dev
📌 2️⃣ Install MediaPipe Pose JS
Include via CDN for now:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/pose"></script>
Or install locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @mediapipe/pose
📌 3️⃣ Set Up Webcam Feed
Use a <video> element in React and stream webcam data to it.

📌 4️⃣ Run Pose Detection
Set up MediaPipe Pose to capture frames from webcam, detect keypoints, and draw a skeleton overlay on a <canvas> above the video.

Landmark Data Example:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  x: 0.5, y: 0.3, z: -0.1, visibility: 0.99
}
You’ll get 33 landmarks for each frame.

📌 5️⃣ Analyze Swing Form
Use the landmark data to:

Calculate angles (e.g., elbow, shoulder, bat angle)

Detect critical positions during the swing

Identify deviations from expected values

Provide live corrective feedback (on-screen text or color alerts)

📌 6️⃣ Build Clean UI
Use Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern layout

Live video + skeleton overlay

Real-time stats display (bat angle, elbow height etc.)

Feedback section

📌 7️⃣ Optional: Backend for Session Storage
If you want to save swing reports:

Set up FastAPI

Send swing metrics via POST request

Store in SQLite / PostgreSQL

Show user history

🎨 Final Deliverable
A web app you can open on phone or desktop to analyze batting form in real-time via webcam with skeleton overlays and actionable feedback.

🔥 Want me to write you a working prototype codebase for:
Setting up React + MediaPipe Pose + webcam feed + skeleton overlay?
If yes — just say the word and I’ll spin that up for you 👌
